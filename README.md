# MotoGMultitaskingFixer

**This app is deprecated due to changes in [CM upstream](http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/88009/)!**

This app fixes multitasking issues with CM12 ROMs by altering permissions of the files /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree. 
Their permissions is 220 by default, this apps' change to 660 fixes RAM issues again. Also default values are applied
(see /app/src/main/java/de/visi0nary/motogmultitaskingfixer/ApplyPermissionsService.java.setReasonableMinfrees())
